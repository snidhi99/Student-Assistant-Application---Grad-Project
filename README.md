# Student-Assistant-Application---Grad-Project

The main aim of developing the "Students Assistant System" is to provide an easy way not only to automate all the functionalities of a college and to help the students. The Students Assistant System is not a product to be sold, but it is a bridge between the College and the Students. Thus, the core purpose of designing the "Students Assistant System" is to manage the tasks assigned to college students and reduce the time to manage the different tasks.

An application that would help in notifying the students of meeting deadlines for such tasks would prove to be pretty useful. This would help to make a studentâ€™s life easier by solving a common issue that is faced by students. This project would also create a student assistant application that would provide notifications to remind a student to work on assignments, apply for jobs, register for courses, and submission before deadlines with a robust user interface. Additionally, this would prove to be an educational experience as we would be able to demonstrate the application of UML analysis, design, and implementation techniques.
